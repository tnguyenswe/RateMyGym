# RateMyGym

In order to run the full stack web app, you will need to run the back end and front end simultaneously.

Follow the commands to do so:

```
  git clone https://github.com/tnguyenswe/RateMyGym.git
  cd RateMyGym
```

From there, you will need to have 2 terminal windows open. In one:

```
  cd back-end
  npm install
  npm run start
```

In the other

```
  cd front-end
  npm install
  npm run start
```

Then you can navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to view the front end.

# RateMyGym

In order to run the full stack web app, you will need to download and install Node.js and npm, then run the back end and front end simultaneously.

Reference for downloading Node.js and npm: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

After downloading Node.js and npm to your device, follow the commands to do so:
```
  git clone https://github.com/tnguyenswe/RateMyGym.git
  cd RateMyGym
```

From there, you will need to have 2 terminal windows open. In one:

```
  cd back-end
  npm install
  npm run start
```

In the other

```
  cd front-end
  npm install
  npm run start
```

Then you can navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to view the front end.
